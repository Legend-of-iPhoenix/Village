# Village

An esoteric programming language about being a forgetful village chief.

## Documentation

Documentation can be found in the `/docs/` folder.

I recommend starting with `syntax.md` so that you get a basic idea of how the language is formatted and moving on to using `commands.md` as a guide and reference..

## Interpreter

You can check out my horribly-styled interpreter [here](https://legend-of-iphoenix.github.io/Village/).
